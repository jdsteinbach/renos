###CMN Starter Theme: Functions

A Directory for all the required PHP functions for the theme, as well as a bunch of functions that you may find useful.  These could all be in `../functions.php` but this is just a bit tidier.

If you need to add any functions as you build the site, add them to `functions.php`.  This way others who come in after you can quickly see what custom PHP you had to write to fulfill required tasks/functionality.
