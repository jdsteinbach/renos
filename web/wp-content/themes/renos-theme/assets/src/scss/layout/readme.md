Layout
======

**Add, edit and delete as needed.**

=== What is it?

'layout/' is for **global** sections of the design that appear on all, or most pages on your site.  Things that you know you're always going to have, no matter what.  For example:

* Header
* Footer
* Navigation (probably in the header, but it's nice to have it seperated)
* Your grid (general columns, widths etc from the design that are common to most of the site)

=== What about [...], should it go here?

So you've got something in the design and you're not sure if this is the best place for it.  Try running through the following questions - if you can answer yes to most of them, it's probably `layout/`.  If not, it's probably a `page/` or a `unit/`.
