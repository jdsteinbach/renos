Base
====

**Nothing in `base/` should be edited.**

### What is it?

`base/` is the **simple foundation** of your project that all other CSS builds on.  It supposes very little.

It mostly consists of `normalize.css` which was added as a Bower dependancy when you ran `bower install` and then copied into `base/` when you ran `gulp build --dev`.

### Helpers

`helpers` is a small collection of simple CSS classes that can be added to HTML elements **that do not already have a class** if you need that element to do something in particular, like `float: right`.

But if the element already has a class, just add the rule to that class ruleset instead of using `@extend` or adding an additional class from `helpers` to the HTML element.

As helpers are compiled to the final CSS, we're keeping the list compact.  If you've something you think should be a helper class and you can back it up by showing it's use on multiple sites, open a ticket for it.  Just because it **could** be used on multiple site doesn't make it a helper.  Only when it **is** used on multiple sites.

### A note on `%cf`

Burbon does provide a mixin for clearfix which you could use in a ruleset with `@include clearfix`.  But this means that every ruleset you use this in will have the few lines of CSS generated by the mixin added to it.  That's not very DRY.

Instead, use `@extend %cf`.  This will string together all the classes/ids that use `%cf` in the `%cf` defination, reducing your CSS overhead.
